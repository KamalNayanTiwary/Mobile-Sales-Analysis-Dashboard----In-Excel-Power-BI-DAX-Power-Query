# Mobile Sales Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Objective   
To design and develop an **Interactive Mobile Sales Analytics Dashboard** in **Power BI** that delivers real-time insights into total sales, quantities, transactions, customer ratings, and payment behavior across brands, models, cities, and time.

The dashboard enables stakeholders to track **KPIs**, analyze performance by **brand/model/city/month/day**, understand **customer sentiment**, and make **data-driven decisions** for inventory, marketing, and channel optimization.

## 🚨 Business Problem  
Smartphone retail is competitive and fast-moving. Teams need a single source of truth to:

- Identify **top-performing brands and models**  
- Track **monthly and weekly seasonality** in demand  
- Understand **city-level** coverage and hotspots  
- Evaluate **payment method mix** to optimize checkout and offers  
- Gauge **customer ratings** distribution to improve product and support

## ❓ Key Questions (KPIs)  
- Which **brands and models** contribute most to sales and quantity?  
- How do **monthly quantities** trend across the year?  
- Which **cities** show stronger sales footprints?  
- What’s the **payment method split** across UPI / Debit / Credit / Cash?

- **Data Transformation:** Built calculated columns and **DAX measures** for KPIs (sales, qty, transactions, averages, shares).  
- **Data Modeling:** Star schema with fact table(s) and dimension tables (Date, Brand, Model, City, Payment Method).  
- **Visualization Setup:** KPIs, **map** (Sales by City), **line charts** (Month & Day trends), **bar charts** (Ratings, Models), **pie** (Payment Method), and a **brand summary table**.  
- **Dashboard Design:** Global slicers for **Brand, Mobile Model, Payment Method, City, Month** with clear typography and consistent layout.
